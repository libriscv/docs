## Examples

### VM call example

Guest Function:
```c
long my_function(
    const char* arg1, 
    const bool arg2, 
    const struct my_struct* arg3, 
    size_t arg4, 
    float arg5
    );
```

Input values:
```c
const char* mystring = "";
const bool  mybool = true;
const struct mystruct s;
const size_t mysize = 4;
const float  myfloat = 5.0f;
```

C++ Host:
```cpp
long result = machine.vmcall(guest_function_address,
	mystring, mybool, mystruct, mysize, myfloat);
```
